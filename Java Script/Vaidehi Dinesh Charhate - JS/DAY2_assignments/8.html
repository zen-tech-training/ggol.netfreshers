        User with Address:
    - Create a constructor function `User` with properties `username` and `password`.
    - Create a constructor function `Address` with properties `street`, `city`, and `country`.
    - Add an `address` property to the `User` constructor that holds an `Address` instance.
    - Add a method `getAddress` to the `User` prototype that returns the user's address as a formatted string.
