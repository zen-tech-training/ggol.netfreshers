        1. Go for Base class Vehicle.

                And 2 derived classes

                    this.wheels = 4;
                }

                    this.wheels = 2;
                }

                Do the inheritance with Vehicle and Car as well as on Vehicle and Bike
                Instantiate Car and Bike

                Use type of to check the type of the Car and Bike Object

                Use instance of to check Car Object is of type Vehicle, Car, or Bike
                Use instance of to check Bike Object is of type Vehicle, Car, or Bike

                Use constructor property to see whether,
                CarObject.constructor property pointing to also check whether,
                BikeObject.constructor property pointing to

                Also check,
                getPrototypeOf(carObj) is equal to Car.Prototype and 
                getPrototypeOf(bikeObj) is equal to Bike.Prototype
