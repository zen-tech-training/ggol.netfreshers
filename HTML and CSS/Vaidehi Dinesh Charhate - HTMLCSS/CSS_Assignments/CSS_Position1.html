            Biological diversity, or biodiversity, is crucial for the health of our planet. It provides us with clean air and water, fertile soil for agriculture, and natural resources for food, medicine, and shelter. Biodiversity also helps regulate our climate, control pests and diseases, and supports the pollination of crops. Without it, our world would be a much less vibrant and sustainable place to live.Biological diversity, or biodiversity, is crucial for the health of our planet.
